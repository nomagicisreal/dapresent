# dapresent
dapresent is a library on [Pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dapresent)
I want to implement this library more after fully considering user preferences regarding ui complexity.\
In other words, I want to implement [nomisal_ui](https://pub.dev/packages/nomisal_ui) first before implement this library.

see also:
- [dastore](https://pub.dev/packages/dastore)
  - it's a library similar to dapresent, not my first priority for now
  - in contrast to this library, it's about backend.
- [damath](https://pub.dev/packages/damath).
  - there are some math, algorithm i known, but maybe i've implemented in a stupid way i don't know.
  - i hope that i can implement more abstract concept in the future, not limit to 'pure' math or algorithm. 
- [datter](https://pub.dev/packages/datter)
  - it's a library for my realistic common usecase in dart & flutter in my acquisition
  - it's an api for me to develop flutter project, integrating my separate ideas.
  - i hope i can do more contribution in the future, not only [mationani](https://pub.dev/packages/mationani) and [overlay_model](https://pub.dev/packages/overlay_model).

I'm also working through these library in my own speed. randomly. freely:
- [nomisal_ui](https://pub.dev/packages/nomisal_ui)
- [nomisal_res](https://pub.dev/packages/nomisal_res)
- [nomisal_app](https://pub.dev/packages/nomisal_app)

they are the three main library helping me to build my dreaming application, a future social media.\
it looks like nothing is there at this moment. I know. I'm just 22 years old.
